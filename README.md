## Overview of AREA üîé

AREA (Action Reaction) is an automation platform designed to automate interactions between various services. Inspired by platforms like IFTTT (If This Then That) and Zapier, AREA aims to provide users with a means to automate repetitive tasks.

### Main Objectives:

- Provide an intuitive user interface for creating and managing automations.
- Integrate a variety of popular services and enable seamless interactions between them.

### Key Features:

- Automation Creation: Users can create automations by linking an action from one service to a reaction from another service.
- User Management: Users can register, log in, and manage their profiles.
- Service Management: Users can connect and manage different services to their AREA account.

### General Architecture:

- Server: The heart of AREA, managing users, services, and automations.
- Web Client: A web interface for users to interact with the platform.
- Mobile Client: A mobile application for interaction on mobile devices.
- Database: Stores user data, service configurations, and automations.

These external services are integrated into AREA, allowing users to link their accounts from these platforms with their AREA profile, thus facilitating the automation of interactions between various services.

To enhance this experience, AREA employs the concept of "ingredients."
Ingredients are key data snippets extracted from triggers, automatically identified to simplify the creation of actions. Ingredients might include device names, trigger times, or other service-specific data. Look for the flask icon to use them in action setups, adding a layer of customization to your automation flows.
